4. **Unzip the Files**: If the files are in a compressed format (like .zip or .tar.gz), extract them to a folder on your computer.

5. **Compile the Library**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files using the `cd` command.
   - Run the following command to compile Vec:
     ```bash
     gcc -o vec vec.c
     ```
   - This will create an executable file named `vec`.

6. **Run the Program**: After compiling, type the following in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   ./vec
   ```
   This will launch the application.

## 🌟 Features

Vec offers several key features:

- **Dynamic Arrays**: Create arrays that can grow in size as you add elements, without predefined limits.
- **Easy Memory Management**: Forget about manual memory handling. Vec automatically takes care of it.
- **Fast Performance**: Enjoy O(1) amortized time complexity on array expansion.

## 📝 Basic Usage

Once you have Vec running, here is how you can use it to create and manipulate dynamic arrays:

1. **Creating a New Array**:
   Use `vec_create()` to initiate a new dynamic array.

2. **Adding Elements**:
   Use `vec_push()` to add items to your array easily.

3. **Accessing Elements**:
   Access items directly with indexing, just like a regular array.

4. **Cleaning Up**:
   Always remember to manage memory properly. Use `vec_free()` to release memory when done.

## 💡 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider these common solutions:

- **Compiler Errors**: Check if you have the correct compiler set up.
- **Missing Files**: Ensure all source files are present in your extraction folder.
- **Permission Issues**: Run your terminal or command prompt with administrative privileges if needed.
